  artifact types as defined in the TOSCA Simple Profile for YAML v1.3
  specification.

  tosca.artifacts.Root:
    description: >-
      The TOSCA Artifact Type all other TOSCA Artifact Types derive
      from

  tosca.artifacts.File:
    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Root
    description: >
      This artifact type is used when an artifact definition needs to
      have its associated file simply treated as a file and no special
      handling/handlers are invoked.

  tosca.artifacts.Deployment:
    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Root
    description: >-
      TOSCA base type for deployment artifacts

  tosca.artifacts.Deployment.Image:
    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Deployment
    description: >
      This artifact type represents a parent type for any “image”
      which is an opaque packaging of a TOSCA Node’s deployment
      (whether real or virtual) whose contents are typically already
      installed and pre-configured (i.e., “stateful”) and prepared to
      be run on a known target container.

  tosca.artifacts.Deployment.Image.VM:
    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Deployment.Image
    description: >
      This artifact represents the parent type for all Virtual Machine
      (VM) image and container formatted deployment artifacts.  These
      images contain a stateful capture of a machine (e.g., server)
      including operating system and installed software along with any
      configurations and can be run on another machine using a
      hypervisor which virtualizes typical server (i.e., hardware)
      resources.  Virtual Machine (VM) Image

  tosca.artifacts.Implementation:
    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Root
    description: >-
      TOSCA base type for implementation artifacts

  tosca.artifacts.Implementation.Bash:
    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Implementation
    description: >-
      Script artifact for the Unix Bash shell
    mime_type: application/x-sh

    derived_from: tosca.artifacts.Implementation
    description: >-
      Artifact for the interpreted Python language
    mime_type: application/x-python
    file_ext: [ py ]
